PICOS18 - Real-time kernel for PIC18 family



03rd August 2003   - PICOS18 release 1.11
  * new feature    : All the files
                     Added device.inc and device.h in PICOS18
                     to specify everything target specific.
                     taskdesc.c
                     Use now the ID of the task defined in task.h.
                     kernel.asm & task_led.c
                     Added a STACK_SIZE define to modify the size
                     of the tempdata area for each task.
  * bug correction : pro_man.c
                     Fixed a bug in TerminateTask & ChainTask
                     (original address was not restored properly).

                     Add DeclareRAM(RamStartAddress) macro
                     in order to let the linker solve the 
                     data & code section symbols.
  * bug correction : kernel.asm

                     Replace #include <pic...h> by "kernel.h".
                     Suppress the #include <pic...h> in *.asm & *.c.
                     Check #include "pro_man.h" presence in every files.
                     Add INFINITIVE alarm feature to use an alarm forever

11th November 2002-  PICOS18 release 1.03
  * bug correction : alarm.c
                     even_man.c
                     kernel.asm
                     pro_man.c
                     pro_man.h
                     timer.c
                     Kernel and services are not interruptible, 
                     so I need to add calls to CGI & SGI macros
                     (CGI/SGI for Clear/Set General Interrupt).

10th November 2002-  PICOS18 release 1.02
  * bug correction : timer.c
                     The wrong condition "if (alarm_ptr->flag > 1)"
                     is not enough to set an EVENT.
                     Replaced by "if (alarm_ptr->flag & ACTIVATETASK)".


2d  November 2002 -  PICOS18 release 1.01
  * bug correction : alarm.h
                     MPLAB-C18 demo compiler v1.00.31
                     is not able to compute typedef &
                     struct in the same line.


1st November 2002 -  PICOS18 release 1.0
  * initial release
